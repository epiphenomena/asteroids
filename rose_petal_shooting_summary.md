# Rose Enhancement Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the rose functionality to shoot poison bullets from each petal, creating a more organic and visually appealing attack pattern. This makes roses more effective at eliminating army men while maintaining a balanced gameplay experience.

## Features Added

### 1. Petal-Based Poison Shooting
- Roses now shoot poison bullets from each of their 8 petals
- Creates a natural, flower-like attack pattern
- Bullets emerge from petal positions for organic visual effect

### 2. Rotating Petals
- Petals slowly rotate to create dynamic visual effect
- Shooting direction changes gradually for varied coverage
- More visually appealing than static directional shooting

### 3. Balanced Shooting Frequency
- Shoots every 5 seconds (300 frames at 60fps)
- Provides consistent pressure without overwhelming
- Balanced timing for strategic gameplay

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Functions
- `createRose()`: Added petal count and rotation angles
- `updateRoses()`: Updated for petal-based shooting with rotation
- `drawRoses()`: Enhanced visual representation with rotating petals
- `fireRosePoisonBullet()`: Works with petal angles (unchanged)

### New Behavior
- Roses shoot 8 poison bullets every 5 seconds from petal positions
- Each petal rotates slowly, creating changing shooting angles
- Bullets automatically despawn when they go off-screen
- No targeting logic - bullets shoot from current petal orientations

## Game Balance Improvements

### Enhanced Effectiveness
- **Before**: Roses shot in fixed 8 directions
- **After**: Roses shoot from rotating petal positions
- **Result**: More natural coverage with evolving patterns

### Strategic Value
- **Placement Importance**: Rose positioning affects petal coverage
- **Timing Awareness**: Players can anticipate shooting cycles
- **Area Control**: Organic patterns provide interesting coverage zones

### Visual Appeal
- **Dynamic Petals**: Rotating petals create living flower effect
- **Natural Shooting**: Bullets emerge from petal positions
- **Organic Patterns**: Coverage evolves over time

## Wave Progression Impact

### Rose Spawning
- Roses spawn every 2 waves (starting at wave 2)
- Consistent availability throughout mid and late game
- Multiple roses create overlapping coverage zones

### Overall Effect
- **Early Game**: Roses provide area control sooner
- **Mid Game**: Multiple roses create complex coverage patterns
- **Late Game**: Dense poison bullet fields from multiple roses

## Player Experience Improvements

### Satisfaction
- **Visual Appeal**: Rotating petals are more engaging to watch
- **Natural Feel**: Flower-like shooting feels organic and satisfying
- **Clear Feedback**: Players can see petal rotations and shooting

### Challenge Balance
- **Army Men**: Face periodic but varied pressure patterns
- **Player**: Must account for rotating petal coverage
- **Strategy**: Positioning becomes more nuanced with rotating patterns

## Technical Details

### Performance Considerations
- **Bullet Count**: 8 bullets per rose every 5 seconds (1.6 bullets/second per rose)
- **Memory Management**: Off-screen bullets are automatically cleaned up
- **Collision Detection**: Efficient checking for army men collisions

### Compatibility
- **Existing Code**: Works with existing collision systems
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to other game systems
- **Scalable**: Can support multiple roses without performance issues

The enhancement makes roses visually distinctive helper objects that provide natural area control through petal-based shooting patterns. The rotating petals create evolving coverage that adds strategic depth while maintaining the organic flower theme.
