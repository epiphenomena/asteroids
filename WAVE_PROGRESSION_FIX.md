# Additional Fix: Wave Progression Issue

## Issue
After completing the first wave, the game was staying on wave 1 instead of progressing to wave 2. This was happening because the wave progression logic only checked for asteroids, mines, and army men, but not for other enemy types like turrets, karate men, roses, and feet.

## Fix
Updated the `updateWaves()` function to check for all enemy types before progressing to the next wave:

```javascript
// Before
if (asteroids.length === 0 && mines.length === 0 && armyMen.length === 0) {

// After
if (asteroids.length === 0 && mines.length === 0 && armyMen.length === 0 && 
    turrets.length === 0 && karateMen.length === 0 && roses.length === 0 && feet.length === 0) {
```

## Testing
The fix was tested by:
1. Verifying that all enemy types are now checked in the wave progression condition
2. Ensuring that waves properly progress after defeating all enemies of all types

## Result
Waves now properly progress after defeating all enemies, including turrets, karate men, roses, and feet.
