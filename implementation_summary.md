# Game Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

### 1. Core Game Mechanics
- Player ship with thrust and rotation controls
- Automatic shooting system
- Collision detection and response
- Score tracking and high score persistence
- Lives system with respawn mechanics
- Particle effects for explosions

### 2. Enemy Types

#### Asteroids
- Classic space rocks that bounce around the screen
- Split into smaller asteroids when shot
- Three sizes (large, medium, small) with different point values

#### Mines
- Red explosives that detonate when asteroids are nearby
- Area-of-effect explosions that can destroy multiple objects
- Higher point value than regular asteroids

#### Turrets
- Stationary enemies that shoot at the player
- Positioned around screen edges
- Shoot in sequences with cooldown periods

#### Army Men
- Enemy soldiers that actively chase the player
- Faster movement with acceleration-based physics
- Spawn in groups for challenging encounters

### 3. Powerups

#### Bullet Size Powerup
- Increases the size of player bullets
- Makes bullets more effective at hitting targets
- Appears as yellow pulsing stars

### 4. Helper Objects

#### Roses
- Friendly plants that shoot poison at army men
- Automatically target nearby enemies
- Help the player by eliminating threats

### 5. Quality of Life Features

#### Radar System
- Shows arrows indicating direction of off-screen objects
- Color-coded by object type for quick identification
- Helps players navigate and avoid threats

#### Visual Improvements
- Ship blinking when invincible after respawn
- Smooth animations and particle effects
- Clear visual distinction between object types

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- Canvas-based rendering for smooth performance
- Object-oriented approach with arrays for each entity type
- Event-driven input handling for mouse/touch controls

### Physics System
- World-relative coordinate system with ship at center
- Velocity-based movement with acceleration and friction
- Screen wrapping for all objects
- Proper collision detection with distance calculations

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient rendering with off-screen object culling
- Particle system with lifetime management
- Optimized collision detection loops
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth gameplay
