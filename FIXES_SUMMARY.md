# Asteroids Game Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Spawning into a new wave and dying immediately**
   - Enemies were spawning too close to the player position
   - Fixed by increasing the minimum spawn distance for all enemy types

2. **Turrets dying when they appear on screen**
   - Turrets were being hit by other enemies or bullets immediately after spawning
   - Fixed by increasing spawn distances and improving collision detection

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Enemy Spawn Distances

Modified the following functions to ensure enemies spawn at safe distances from the player:

- `createAsteroid()`: Increased minimum distance from 200 to 300 pixels
- `createArmyMan()`: Increased minimum distance from 200 to 300 pixels
- `createKarateMan()`: Increased minimum distance from 200 to 300 pixels
- `createTurret()`: Increased minimum distance from 150 to 250 pixels

### 2. Improved Collision Detection

Fixed index management in collision detection functions to prevent issues when removing multiple objects:

- `checkCollisions()`: Fixed index adjustments when removing bullets and enemies
- Removed automatic wave creation from collision handlers that was causing issues

### 3. Wave Spawning Improvements

- Added temporary invincibility for the ship when a new wave spawns
- This gives the player time to react to new enemies without immediate collisions

### 4. Turret Placement Improvements

- Enhanced turret placement algorithm to avoid collisions with other objects
- Increased minimum distances between turrets and other enemies

## Testing

The fixes have been tested through:
1. Code review to ensure proper distance calculations
2. Verification of collision detection logic
3. Confirmation that wave spawning works correctly
4. Browser testing to ensure gameplay is smooth and fair

## Results

- Players no longer die immediately when a new wave spawns
- Turrets no longer disappear unexpectedly when they appear on screen
- Enemies spawn at appropriate distances, providing fair gameplay challenge
- Collision detection works properly without index errors
