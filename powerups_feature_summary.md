# Powerups Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added powerups that increase the size of bullets when collected by the player. These powerups appear as yellow stars that pulse on screen.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Structures
- Added `powerups` array to track all powerup objects
- Added `bulletSizeMultiplier` variable to track bullet size multiplier (starts at 1.0)
- Each powerup has:
  - Position (x, y)
  - Radius (12)
  - Type ('bulletSize')
  - Pulse animation value

### 2. Spawning
- Added `createPowerup()` function to spawn powerups at random positions
- Powerups are created away from the center to avoid immediate collection
- Three powerups are created at game start

### 3. Movement
- Added `updatePowerups()` function to update powerup animations
- Powerups wrap around screen edges like other game objects
- Powerups move with the world physics

### 4. Rendering
- Added `drawPowerups()` function to render powerups as yellow pulsing stars
- Star shape with 5 points and inner points for visual appeal
- Pulsing animation effect using sine wave

### 5. Collection
- Added collision detection for ship-powerup collisions
- When collected, bullet size multiplier increases by 0.5
- Powerups grant 50 points when collected
- Visual explosion effect when collected

### 6. Bullet Size Effect
- Modified `fireBullet()` function to use `bulletSizeMultiplier`
- Bullet radius is now `2 * bulletSizeMultiplier`
- Larger bullets are more effective at destroying asteroids

### 7. Integration
- Added powerups to the main game loop
- Integrated with existing collision detection system
- Works with world coordinate system

## Files Modified
- `script.js` - Main game implementation
- `test_powerups.js` - Test script for powerups functionality
- `test_powerups.html` - Test HTML file

## How to Test
1. Open `test_powerups.html` in a browser
2. Click "START TEST"
3. Three yellow star powerups will appear on screen
4. Fly over powerups to collect them
5. Observe bullet size increase after collection
6. Check score increases by 50 points per powerup
