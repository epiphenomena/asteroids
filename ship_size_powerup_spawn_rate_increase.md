# Ship Size Powerup Spawn Rate Increase

## Overview
Increased the spawn rate of ship size powerups from 20% to 30% of all powerups to make them more readily available to players. This change allows players more opportunities to experiment with larger ships and adds strategic depth to powerup collection decisions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Powerup Spawn Rate Increase
- **Before**: 20% ship size, 60% bullet size, 20% force field
- **After**: 30% ship size, 50% bullet size, 20% force field
- **Impact**: 50% increase in ship size powerup availability

### 2. Wave-Based Enemy Spawning
Added a progressive enemy spawning system that increases challenge over time:

#### Wave Progression
- **Wave 1**: 1 asteroid, 0 mines, 0 army men, 1 rose, powerups
- **Wave 2**: 2 asteroids, 0 mines, 0 army men, 1 rose, powerups
- **Wave 3**: 3 asteroids, 1 mine, 3 army men, 1 rose, powerups
- **Wave 4**: 4 asteroids, 1 mine, 3 army men, 1 turret, 1 rose, powerups
- **Wave 5**: 5 asteroids, 1 mine, 3 army men, 1 turret, 1 rose, powerups
- **Wave 6**: 6 asteroids, 2 mines, 6 army men, 1 turret, 2 roses, powerups
- **And so on...**

#### Enemy Scaling
- **Asteroids**: 1 new asteroid every wave (linear increase)
- **Mines**: 1 new mine every 3 waves (step increase)
- **Army Men**: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 army men every 3 waves (progressive groups)
- **Turrets**: 1 new turret every 3 waves (starting at wave 4)
- **Roses**: 1 new rose every 2 waves (starting at wave 2)
- **Powerups**: Force field powerups every wave, bullet size powerups with increased frequency

### 3. Extra Powerup Spawning
Added additional powerup spawning after wave 5:

#### Post-Wave 5 Spawning
- **Wave 6+**: 1 extra powerup every 2 waves
- **Wave 8+**: 2 extra powerups every 2 waves
- **Wave 10+**: 3 extra powerups every 2 waves
- **And so on...**

#### Extra Powerup Types
- **70% chance** for each extra powerup to spawn
- **Distribution**: Maintains 30% ship size, 50% bullet size, 20% force field ratio
- **Frequency**: Extra powerups spawn more frequently as game progresses

### 4. Overall Powerup Frequency
Increased the overall powerup spawn rate:

- **Before**: 40% chance per wave
- **After**: 60% chance per wave
- **Impact**: 50% increase in powerup availability

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Functions
- `resetGame()`: Updated to use wave-based enemy spawning
- `spawnWaveEnemies()`: Added wave progression logic
- `updateWaves()`: Integrated wave timer and extra powerup spawning
- Powerup creation functions: Updated spawn probabilities

### New Variables
- `waveNumber`: Current wave number (starts at 1)
- `waveTimer`: Timer for wave progression (resets every 1800 frames)
- `maxWaveTimer`: Maximum wave timer (1800 frames = 30 seconds at 60fps)
- `shipSizeMultiplier`: Ship size multiplier (1.0 = normal, 1.3 = 30% larger, etc.)

### New Functions
- `updateWaves()`: Manages wave timer and progression
- `spawnWaveEnemies()`: Spawns appropriate enemies for current wave
- `updateWaveSystem()`: Updates wave timer and extra powerup spawning

## Game Balance Improvements

### Strategic Depth
- **Powerup Collection**: More frequent ship size powerups create meaningful choices
- **Risk vs Reward**: Players must weigh benefits of larger ships against collision risk
- **Timing Decisions**: More opportunities to collect at optimal moments
- **Resource Management**: Regular powerups help manage increasing difficulty

### Player Experience
- **Accessibility**: More frequent ship size powerups make larger ships more accessible
- **Satisfaction**: Regular rewards for successful gameplay
- **Progression**: Clear sense of advancement with increasing powerup availability
- **Engagement**: Consistent powerup flow maintains player interest

### Challenge Maintenance
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Wave progression maintains increasing challenge
- **Enemy Variety**: Multiple enemy types provide diverse threats
- **Resource Availability**: Regular powerups help players manage difficulty
- **Strategic Complexity**: More choices create deeper gameplay

## Probability Analysis

### Powerup Distribution (Per 1000 Samples)
- **Ship Size**: 300 (30%) - Increased from 200 (20%)
- **Bullet Size**: 500 (50%) - Decreased from 600 (60%)
- **Force Field**: 200 (20%) - Unchanged
- **Total**: 1000 (100%)

### Statistical Impact
- **Increase**: 50% more ship size powerups (200 → 300)
- **Decrease**: 16.7% fewer bullet size powerups (600 → 500)
- **Unchanged**: Force field powerups (200 → 200)
- **Net Effect**: More balanced powerup distribution

## Player Experience Enhancements

### Immediate Benefits
- **Availability**: Ship size powerups spawn 50% more frequently
