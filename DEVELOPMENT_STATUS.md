# Asteroids Game - Current Development Status

## Project Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of development for the Asteroids game implementation. The project has been completed with all requested features implemented and thoroughly tested.

## Current Implementation Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All features implemented and functioning correctly

## Core Game Features

### Ship Controls
- ✅ Ship always rotates toward mouse/touch position
- ✅ Ship accelerates when mouse/touch is held
- ✅ Automatic shooting at fixed rate
- ✅ Touch/mouse controls work on both desktop and mobile devices

### Game Mechanics
- ✅ 3 lives per game
- ✅ Ship disappears for 2 seconds after collision
- ✅ 3-second invincibility period after respawn
- ✅ Ship cannot shoot while invincible or dead
- ✅ Proper game over detection and screen display

### Asteroid Behavior
- ✅ Large asteroids (size 3) split into two medium asteroids (size 2)
- ✅ Medium asteroids (size 2) split into two small asteroids (size 1)
- ✅ Small asteroids (size 1) are destroyed when shot (no further splitting)
- ✅ All asteroids only split once when destroyed
- ✅ Asteroids spawn at safe distances to prevent immediate collisions

### Scoring System
- ✅ 10 points per small asteroid destroyed
- ✅ 20 points per medium asteroid destroyed
- ✅ 30 points per large asteroid destroyed
- ✅ High score tracking with localStorage persistence

### User Interface
- ✅ Start screen with start button
- ✅ Game over screen with restart button
- ✅ Live score display
- ✅ Lives counter (3 lives)
- ✅ High score display
- ✅ Visual feedback for invincibility (blinking effect)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Game Architecture
- ✅ HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- ✅ Vanilla JavaScript for game logic (no external libraries)
- ✅ Responsive design for various screen sizes
- ✅ Touch event support for mobile devices
- ✅ Efficient game loop using requestAnimationFrame

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Optimized collision detection algorithms
- ✅ Efficient particle system for visual effects
- ✅ Proper memory management for game objects
- ✅ Smooth 60 FPS gameplay on most devices

### State Management
- ✅ Proper game state transitions (start, playing, game over)
- ✅ Accurate tracking of ship, asteroid, and bullet states
- ✅ Correct handling of invincibility and respawn timers
- ✅ Robust collision detection and response

## Game Flow

### Startup Sequence
1. Player loads webpage
2. Start screen appears with "START GAME" button
3. Player clicks start button to begin game

### Gameplay Loop
1. Ship automatically fires bullets at fixed rate
2. Player controls ship rotation (mouse/touch) and thrust (hold)
3. Asteroids move around the playfield
4. Bullets destroy asteroids on contact
5. Ship collides with asteroids → lose life
6. After 3 lives lost → game over

### Death/Respawn Sequence
1. Ship collides with asteroid
2. Explosion particles created at collision point
3. Life lost (lives counter decrements)
4. Ship disappears for 2 seconds (120 frames)
5. Ship respawns at center
6. Ship gains 3 seconds of invincibility (blinking effect)
7. During invincibility:
   - Ship cannot be hit by asteroids
   - Ship cannot shoot bullets
8. After invincibility ends → normal gameplay resumes

### Game Over Sequence
1. Player loses all 3 lives
2. Game over screen appears
3. Final score and high score displayed
4. "PLAY AGAIN" button shown
5. Player clicks restart button to begin new game

## Configuration Settings

### Timing Values
- Ship shooting cooldown: 20 frames (~0.33 seconds at 60 FPS)
- Ship invisibility after death: 120 frames (2 seconds)
- Ship invincibility after respawn: 180 frames (3 seconds)
- Asteroid respawn delay: 100 frames (~1.67 seconds)

### Physics Values
- Ship acceleration: 0.65 units/frame² (30% faster than base)
- Ship maximum speed: 5 units/frame
- Ship friction: 0.98 (gradual slowing)
- Bullet speed: 7 units/frame
- Asteroid speeds: 1-3 units/frame (random)

### Visual Settings
- Ship radius: 10 pixels
- Bullet radius: 2 pixels
- Large asteroid radius: 30 pixels (size 3)
- Medium asteroid radius: 20 pixels (size 2)
- Small asteroid radius: 10 pixels (size 1)
