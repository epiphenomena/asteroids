# Turret Collision Fix

## Overview
Fixed the issue where turrets were getting destroyed immediately upon spawning due to collisions with asteroids or mines.

## Problem
Turrets were being created at fixed positions that could coincide with the positions of asteroids or mines, causing immediate collisions when the game started. This happened because:
1. Turrets were placed at specific screen corners
2. Asteroids were spawned randomly, including possibly at the same positions
3. No collision detection was performed during turret placement

## Solution
Implemented collision detection and avoidance in the `createTurret()` function:

### 1. Minimum Distance from Center
- Ensured turrets are placed at least 150 pixels away from the center (ship start position)
- This prevents turrets from spawning too close to where the player starts

### 2. Collision Detection with Existing Objects
- Added collision checking against asteroids and mines
- If a collision is detected, the turret is moved to a different screen corner
- Implemented up to 10 attempts to find a safe position
- Used screen corners with random offsets for better positioning

### 3. Improved Positioning Logic
- When a collision is detected, turrets are moved to different corners rather than random positions
- This maintains the intended visual distribution of turrets around the screen edges
- Added random offset (Â±25 pixels) to prevent exact corner stacking

## Files Modified
- `script.js` - Updated `createTurret()` function with collision detection and avoidance

## Testing
Created a test script to verify that turrets are not colliding with asteroids or mines after placement.

## How to Test
1. Start the game normally
2. Observe that turrets appear at screen corners without immediate destruction
3. Check browser console for test results (no collisions should be reported)
