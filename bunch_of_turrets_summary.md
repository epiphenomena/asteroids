# Bunch of Turrets Feature

## Overview
Modified the game to spawn a bunch of turrets (12 total) instead of just 4, positioned around the edges of the screen.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Increased Turret Count
- Increased from 4 to 12 turrets total
- Positioned turrets at all four corners plus additional positions along screen edges
- New positions include:
  - Four corners (as before)
  - Two positions along top edge
  - Two positions along bottom edge
  - Two positions along right edge
  - Two positions along left edge

### 2. Enhanced Collision Detection
- Updated `createTurret()` function to handle increased number of turrets
- Increased collision detection attempts from 10 to 20 to accommodate more turrets
- Added collision checking against other turrets (minimum 35 pixel distance)
- Improved positioning logic to use screen edges instead of just corners
- Added random offsets to prevent exact positioning

### 3. Positioning Logic
- Turrets are now distributed around all screen edges
- When collisions are detected, turrets are moved to random positions along screen edges
- Maintains good visual distribution while preventing overlaps

### 4. Game Balance
- More turrets provide increased challenge for players
- Turrets are still stationary and follow the same shooting patterns
- Players must navigate more carefully to avoid turret fire

## Files Modified
- `script.js` - Updated turret creation and positioning logic

## How to Test
1. Start the game normally
2. Observe that 12 turrets appear around the screen edges
3. Turrets should not overlap with each other or with asteroids/mines
4. Turrets should shoot at the player as expected
