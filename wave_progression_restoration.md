# Wave Progression Restoration

## Overview
Restored the original wave progression system that was accidentally modified. This ensures army men spawn every wave as originally intended, maintaining the intended challenge level and gameplay balance.

## Changes Restored

### 1. Army Men Spawning Frequency
- **Before (Accidentally Modified)**: Army men spawned every 3 waves (wave 3, 6, 9, 12...)
- **After (Restored Original)**: Army men spawn every wave (wave 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...)
- **Impact**: Consistent army men threat maintained throughout gameplay

### 2. Wave Progression Formula
- **Asteroids**: 1 new asteroid every wave (wave 1: 1, wave 2: 2, etc.)
- **Mines**: 1 new mine every 3 waves (wave 3, 6, 9, 12...)
- **Army Men**: 3 army men every wave (consistent threat)
- **Turrets**: 1 new turret every 3 waves (starting at wave 4)
- **Roses**: 1 new rose every 2 waves (starting at wave 2)
- **Powerups**: Variable frequency with force field powerups every wave
- **Force Field**: 1 force field powerup every wave (guaranteed resource)

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Functions
- `spawnWaveEnemies()`: Restored original army men spawning (3 army men every wave)

### New Behavior
- Army men spawn consistently every wave (3 per wave)
- Maintains all other wave progression elements
- Proper balance between challenge and resource availability

## Game Balance Restoration

### Challenge Level
- **Before**: Reduced army men pressure with intermittent spawning
- **After**: Consistent army men threat as originally designed
- **Impact**: Maintains intended difficulty curve

### Resource Management
- **Army Men**: Present consistent threat requiring regular attention
- **Powerups**: Force field powerups every wave help manage army men
- **Roses**: Provide area control assistance
- **Strategy**: Players must balance multiple threats simultaneously

### Player Experience
- **Consistency**: Predictable army men spawning every wave
- **Challenge**: Maintains pressure without overwhelming spikes
- **Satisfaction**: Regular engagement with army men threat

## Wave Progression Details

### Wave-by-Wave Breakdown
- **Wave 1**: 1 asteroid, 0 mines, 3 army men, 0 turrets, 0 roses
- **Wave 2**: 2 asteroids, 0 mines, 3 army men, 0 turrets, 1 rose
- **Wave 3**: 3 asteroids, 1 mine, 3 army men, 0 turrets, 0 roses
- **Wave 4**: 4 asteroids, 1 mine, 3 army men, 1 turret, 1 rose
- **Wave 5**: 5 asteroids, 1 mine, 3 army men, 1 turret, 0 roses
- **Wave 6**: 6 asteroids, 2 mines, 3 army men, 1 turret, 1 rose
- And so on...

### Enemy Scaling
- **Linear Growth**: Asteroids increase by 1 each wave
- **Step Growth**: Mines increase by 1 every 3 waves
- **Constant Pressure**: Army men present every wave
- **Periodic Additions**: Turrets, roses added at regular intervals

## Player Experience Improvements

### Predictability
- **Army Men**: Know they'll face 3 army men every wave
- **Planning**: Can anticipate regular army men encounters
- **Preparation**: Regular force field powerups help manage threat

### Engagement
- **Consistent Challenge**: Army men provide ongoing pressure
- **Resource Usage**: Force players to regularly use powerups
- **Strategic Depth**: Must balance multiple simultaneous threats

### Skill Development
- **Army Men Management**: Regular practice with army men avoidance
- **Powerup Timing**: Learn when to use force field powerups
- **Positioning**: Develop skills for managing consistent threats

## Technical Details

### Performance Considerations
- **Entity Count**: Consistent army men spawning maintains predictable load
- **Collision Detection**: Regular army men encounters optimize collision systems
- **Memory Management**: Predictable enemy creation patterns

### Compatibility
- **Existing Code**: Fully compatible with all other systems
- **No Breaking Changes**: Maintains all existing functionality
- **Save Files**: No impact on saved game data

The restoration maintains the original wave progression design where army men provide a consistent threat every wave, requiring players to regularly manage this challenge while progressing through the increasing asteroid counts and periodic additions of other enemies. This creates the intended gameplay experience with a steady difficulty curve.
