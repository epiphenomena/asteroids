#### Turret Bullets
- Fired by turrets toward the player
- Move at speed 7 across the screen
- Destroy ship on contact

### Helper Objects

#### Roses (Flower Helpers)
- Friendly pink plants that shoot poison bullets at army men
- 8 rotating petals that shoot poison bullets every 5 seconds
- Each petal shoots poison bullets in its direction for natural spread
