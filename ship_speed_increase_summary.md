# Ship Speed Increase Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

1. **Increased Ship Speed**:
   - Increased maximum ship speed by 15% (from 5 to 5.75)
   - Increased ship acceleration by 15% (from 0.65 to 0.75)
   - Maintained the same friction value (0.98)

## Technical Details

### Modified Values
- `maxSpeed`: Increased from 5 to 5.75 (15% increase)
- `acceleration`: Increased from 0.65 to 0.75 (15% increase)
- `friction`: Unchanged at 0.98

## Balance Considerations

- The speed increase is moderate (15%) to maintain game balance
- Acceleration was increased proportionally to maintain responsive controls
- Friction was kept the same to preserve the feel of ship movement
- The maximum speed is still reasonable for the game's scale
