# Mine Explosion Feature Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

1. **Periodic Mine Explosions**:
   - Mines now periodically check for asteroids within their explosion radius
   - When asteroids are detected, mines explode and destroy the asteroids
   - This happens every 300 frames (5 seconds at 60fps)

2. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Mine explosions create the same visual effects as before
   - Explosion radius is shown with a red circle
   - All objects within the explosion radius are destroyed

3. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Player receives points for mine explosions that destroy asteroids
   - Mine is consumed when it explodes
   - Regular mine collision mechanics remain unchanged

## Technical Details

### Modified Functions
- `updateMines()`: 
  - Added explosion timer to each mine
  - Mines check for asteroids in radius every 300 frames
  - When asteroids are found, mine explodes and destroys them
  - Added explosion timer initialization for new mines

- `createAsteroid()`:
  - Added `explosionTimer` property to mines when created

### New Logic
- Each mine has an `explosionTimer` that increments each frame
- When timer reaches 300 (5 seconds), mine checks for asteroids in 100-pixel radius
- If asteroids are found, mine explodes and destroys them via `checkMineExplosion()`
- Mine is removed from game after exploding
- Player receives points for destroyed asteroids

## Balance Considerations

- Mines explode periodically, not continuously, to maintain challenge
- 5-second interval provides reasonable timing for this mechanic
- Player still needs to strategically target mines to maximize points
- Mine explosions don't affect other mines to prevent chain reactions
- Existing mine collision mechanics (bullets, ship) remain unchanged

## Testing Notes

- Mines will now automatically destroy asteroids that drift into their radius
- This makes mines more dynamic and interactive with the game environment
- Players can use this mechanic strategically by positioning mines near asteroid paths
