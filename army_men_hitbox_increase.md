# Army Men Hitbox Size Increase

## Overview
Increased the hitbox size of army men from radius 8 to radius 12 to make them easier to hit. This change affects both visual representation and collision detection.

## Changes Made

### 1. Hitbox Size
- **Before**: Radius 8 (16 pixels diameter)
- **After**: Radius 12 (24 pixels diameter)
- **Increase**: 50% larger hitbox

### 2. Visual Representation
- Army men now appear as larger triangles on screen
- Visual size matches the increased hitbox size
- Maintains the same red color and triangular shape

### 3. Collision Detection
- Player bullets now have a larger target area
- Rose poison bullets also benefit from larger hitbox
- No changes needed to collision detection code (uses armyMan.radius property)

## Implementation Details

### Modified Functions
- `createArmyMan()`: Changed radius from 8 to 12
- `drawArmyMen()`: Updated visual representation to match larger size

### Technical Impact
- Easier for players to hit army men with bullets
- More forgiving aiming requirements
- Maintains game balance by keeping army men as viable targets

## Game Balance Considerations

### Positive Effects
- **Accessibility**: New players find it easier to hit targets
- **Satisfaction**: Players feel more successful with hits
- **Flow**: Reduced frustration from missed shots
- **Pacing**: Faster elimination of army men threats

### Balance Maintenance
- Army men still provide meaningful challenge
- Movement speed and behavior unchanged
- Point value (25 points) remains the same
- Collision damage to player ship unchanged

## Player Experience Improvements

1. **Reduced Frustration**: Less missed shots due to small targets
2. **Increased Engagement**: More successful hits encourage continued play
3. **Better Feedback**: Larger visual target provides clearer feedback
4. **Skill Development**: Easier to learn basics before mastering precision

The change makes the game more approachable while preserving the core challenge and mechanics.
