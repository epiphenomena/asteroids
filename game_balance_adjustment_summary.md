# Game Balance Adjustment Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Reduced Initial Asteroids**:
   - Decreased initial asteroid count from 5 to 3
   - Updated all wave creation calls to create 3 asteroids instead of 5

2. **Increased Mine Frequency**:
   - Increased chance of mine creation from 10% to 30%
   - This should result in more mines appearing in each wave

3. **Increased Turret Count**:
   - Increased number of turrets from 1 to 4
   - Turrets are now positioned at all four corners of the screen:
     - Top-right corner (original position)
     - Top-left corner
     - Bottom-right corner
     - Bottom-left corner
   - Modified `createTurret()` function to accept position parameters

## Technical Details

### Modified Functions
- `resetGame()`: Updated to create 4 turrets at different positions
- `createAsteroid()`: Changed mine creation chance from 10% to 30%
- `createAsteroids()`: Updated all calls to create 3 asteroids instead of 5
- `createTurret()`: Added optional x and y parameters for positioning

### Balance Considerations
- Reduced asteroid count to prevent screen clutter
- Increased mine frequency to make them more common and valuable
- Added more turrets to increase challenge and variety
- Maintained existing game mechanics and difficulty progression

## Impact
- Game should feel less cluttered with fewer asteroids
- Mines should appear more frequently, making them a more significant part of gameplay
- Four turrets instead of one should provide a greater challenge
- Overall game balance should be improved with better distribution of object types
