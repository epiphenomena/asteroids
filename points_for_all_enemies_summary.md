# Points for All Enemies Killed Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

1. **Points for Ship Collisions**:
   - Player now receives points when destroying asteroids by colliding with them
   - Player now receives points when destroying mines by colliding with them
   - Maintains the existing penalty of losing a life for collisions

2. **Consistent Scoring**:
   - Asteroids: 10 points × size (10, 20, or 30 points)
   - Mines: 15 points × size (15, 30, or 45 points)
   - Turrets: 50 points each
   - Consistent scoring regardless of how enemies are destroyed

## Technical Details

### Modified Functions
- `checkCollisions()`:
  - Added score awarding when ship collides with asteroids
  - Added score awarding when ship collides with mines

### Changes Made
- In ship-asteroid collision detection:
  - Added `score += 10 * asteroid.size;` when asteroid is destroyed
  - Added score UI update

- In ship-mine collision detection:
  - Added `score += 15 * mine.size;` when mine is destroyed
  - Added score UI update

## Balance Considerations

- Players are rewarded for all enemy destruction, encouraging aggressive play
- Collision penalties (losing lives) remain unchanged
- Point values remain consistent with existing game balance
- No changes to enemy behavior or destruction mechanics
- Maintains the risk/reward balance of colliding with enemies

## Testing Notes

- Player now receives points for all enemy destruction methods:
  - Shooting with bullets
  - Colliding with enemies
  - Mine explosions (chain reactions)
  - Periodic mine explosions
  - Turret bullets (when turrets are destroyed by player)

- All point values are displayed in the UI immediately after scoring
- High score tracking continues to work as before
