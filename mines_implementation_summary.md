# Mines Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of mines in the Asteroids game. Mines are special objects that:
1. Look different from regular asteroids (red, dashed circles with a cross)
2. Act as bombs when collided with (more dangerous than regular asteroids)
3. Explode in a radius, destroying nearby objects when hit or collided with
4. Are worth more points when destroyed
5. Have a 10% chance of appearing when asteroids are created

Additionally, when the player's ship collides with a regular asteroid, both the ship and the asteroid are destroyed.

Fixed an issue where the game over screen would appear at the start of a new round.

## Changes Made

### 1. Game State Management
- Added a `mines` array to track mine objects alongside asteroids
- Initialized the mines array in the `resetGame()` function

### 2. Object Creation
- Modified `createAsteroid()` function to randomly create mines (10% chance)
- Mines have the same physics as asteroids but with a `type: 'mine'` property

### 3. Game Loop Updates
- Added `updateMines()` function to handle mine movement and screen wrapping
- Added `drawMines()` function to render mines with distinctive appearance
- Updated the game loop to call these new functions

### 4. Collision Detection
- Enhanced `checkCollisions()` function to handle:
  - Bullet-mine collisions (mines are destroyed, player gets points)
  - Ship-mine collisions (more dangerous, acts like a bomb)
  - Ship-asteroid collisions (both ship and asteroid are destroyed)
- Added `checkMineExplosion()` function to handle radius explosions
- Mines are worth 50% more points than asteroids of the same size

### 5. Explosion Mechanics
- When a mine is hit by a bullet or collided with by the ship, it explodes in a radius of approximately 1 inch (100 pixels)
- All asteroids and mines within the explosion radius are destroyed
- Each destroyed object in the explosion adds to the player's score
- Regular asteroids that are large enough split into smaller ones even when destroyed by explosions

### 6. Visual Enhancements
- Mines are rendered as red dashed circles with a cross inside
- Mine explosions create more particles and have higher velocity
- Each object destroyed in a mine explosion creates its own explosion effect
- When ship collides with asteroid, both create explosion effects
- Mine explosions show a red circle in the explosion radius

### 7. Wave Management
- Updated wave creation logic to account for both asteroids and mines
- New waves are created only when both asteroids and mines are destroyed

## Technical Details

### Mine Creation
```javascript
// In createAsteroid function:
const isMine = Math.random() < 0.1; // 10% chance

if (isMine) {
    mines.push({
        x: x,
        y: y,
        radius: radius,
        velocity: { x: velocityX, y: velocityY },
        size: size,
        type: 'mine'
    });
} else {
    asteroids.push({
        x: x,
        y: y,
        radius: radius,
        velocity: { x: velocityX, y: velocityY },
        size: size
    });
}
```

### Mine Explosion
```javascript
// In checkMineExplosion function:
function checkMineExplosion(x, y, radius) {
    // Check for asteroids within explosion radius
    for (let i = asteroids.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const asteroid = asteroids[i];
        if (distance(x, y, asteroid.x, asteroid.y) < radius) {
            // Destroy asteroid and create explosion
            createExplosion(asteroid.x, asteroid.y, false);
            // Add to score
            score += 10 * asteroid.size;
            // Remove asteroid
            asteroids.splice(i, 1);
            // Split if large enough
            if (asteroid.size > 1) {
                // Create two smaller asteroids
                // ... splitting logic
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Similar logic for mines within explosion radius
}
```

### Ship-Asteroid Collision
```javascript
// In checkCollisions function:
if (distance(0, 0, asteroid.x, asteroid.y) < ship.radius + asteroid.radius) {
    // Create explosion particles for both ship and asteroid
    createExplosion(0, 0, false); // Ship explosion
    createExplosion(asteroid.x, asteroid.y, false); // Asteroid explosion
    
    // Remove the asteroid that was collided with
    asteroids.splice(i, 1);
    
    // Lose a life
    lives--;
    // ... rest of collision handling
}
```

### Mine Rendering
```javascript
// In drawMines function:
ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
ctx.lineWidth = 2;
ctx.setLineDash([5, 3]); // Dashed line for mines

// Draw mine as a circle with a cross inside
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(screenX, screenY, mine.radius, 0, Math.PI * 2);
ctx.stroke();

// Draw cross inside mine
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(screenX - mine.radius * 0.7, screenY - mine.radius * 0.7);
ctx.lineTo(screenX + mine.radius * 0.7, screenY + mine.radius * 0.7);
ctx.moveTo(screenX + mine.radius * 0.7, screenY - mine.radius * 0.7);
ctx.lineTo(screenX - mine.radius * 0.7, screenY + mine.radius * 0.7);
ctx.stroke();
```

## Testing
Created test files to verify:
1. Mines array is properly initialized
2. Mine creation functions work correctly
3. Rendering functions exist and can be called
4. Collision detection handles mines appropriately
5. Explosion radius functionality works

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements could include:
1. Sound effects for mine explosions
2. Different mine behaviors (homing, pulsing, etc.)
3. Special visual effects for mine explosions
4. Power-ups that can detect or disable mines
5. Chain reaction explosions when mines destroy other mines
