# Enemy Motion and Ship Speed Adjustment Summary

## Overview
Adjusted enemy motion and ship speed to improve game balance and player experience. Mines now move independently of ship motion, and ship speed has been reduced for better control.

## Changes Made

### 1. Ship Speed Reduction
- **Acceleration**: Decreased from 0.75 to 0.65 (15% slower)
- **Max Speed**: Decreased from 5.75 to 5.0 (15% slower)
- **Shoot Cooldown**: Increased from 17 to 20 frames (20% slower)
- **Impact**: More controlled movement and reduced firing rate

### 2. Mine Motion Independence
- **World Coordinates**: Mines now use absolute world coordinates
- **Independent Movement**: Not affected by ship velocity
- **Proper Physics**: Maintain consistent velocity regardless of ship motion
- **Screen Wrapping**: Use absolute coordinates for proper wrapping

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Modified Functions
- `resetGame()`: Updated ship physics parameters
- `createAsteroid()`: Added world coordinates for mines
- `updateMines()`: Implemented absolute coordinate system

#### New Behavior
- Ships move 15% slower with reduced acceleration
- Mines maintain constant velocity regardless of ship movement
- Proper screen wrapping using absolute coordinates
- Consistent physics for all game objects

## Technical Implementation

### Ship Physics
```javascript
ship = {
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    radius: 10,
    angle: 0,
    velocity: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    rotationSpeed: 0.05,
    acceleration: 0.65, // Decreased from 0.75 (15% slower)
    maxSpeed: 5.0, // Decreased from 5.75 (15% slower)
    friction: 0.98,
    shootCooldown: 0,
    maxShootCooldown: 20, // Increased from 17 (20% slower)
    invincible: false,
    invincibilityTime: 0,
    respawnTime: 0,
    visible: true
};
```

### Mine Physics
```javascript
// Create a mine with absolute world coordinates
mines.push({
    x: x,
    y: y,
    radius: radius,
    velocity: { x: velocityX, y: velocityY },
    size: size,
    type: 'mine',
    explosionTimer: 0,
    worldX: x, // Absolute world coordinates
    worldY: y  // Absolute world coordinates
});
```

### Update Function
```javascript
// Update mine positions using absolute coordinates
function updateMines() {
    for (let i = mines.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const mine = mines[i];
        
        // Update position using absolute world coordinates
        mine.worldX += mine.velocity.x;
        mine.worldY += mine.velocity.y;
        
        // Update relative position for rendering and collision detection
        mine.x = mine.worldX - ship.x;
        mine.y = mine.worldY - ship.y;
        
        // Screen wrapping using absolute coordinates
        const buffer = 100;
        const leftEdge = - canvas.width / 2 - buffer;
        const rightEdge = canvas.width / 2 + buffer;
        const topEdge = - canvas.height / 2 - buffer;
        const bottomEdge = canvas.height / 2 + buffer;
        
        // Convert relative position to absolute for wrapping
        const absoluteX = mine.worldX;
        const absoluteY = mine.worldY;
        
        if (absoluteX < leftEdge) mine.worldX = rightEdge;
        if (absoluteX > rightEdge) mine.worldX = leftEdge;
        if (absoluteY < topEdge) mine.worldY = bottomEdge;
        if (absoluteY > bottomEdge) mine.worldY = topEdge;
        
        // Update relative position after wrapping
        mine.x = mine.worldX - ship.x;
        mine.y = mine.worldY - ship.y;
    }
}
```

## Game Balance Improvements

### Player Control
- **Reduced Speed**: 15% slower ship for better maneuverability
