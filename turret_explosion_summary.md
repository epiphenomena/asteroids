# Turret Explosion Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

1. **Turret Explosion on Bullet Hit**:
   - When a player bullet hits a turret, the turret explodes
   - Turret explosions create particle effects similar to other explosions
   - Player receives 50 points for destroying a turret
   - Turret is removed from the game after being hit

2. **Collision Detection**:
   - Added bullet-turret collision detection in the `checkCollisions` function
   - Only player bullets can destroy turrets (turret bullets cannot destroy turrets)
   - Turret explosions do not affect nearby objects (unlike mine explosions)

## Technical Details

### Modified Functions
- `checkCollisions()`: Added a new section to check for bullet-turret collisions
  - Loop through all turrets to check for collisions with bullets
  - Create explosion particles when a bullet hits a turret
  - Increase player score by 50 points for each turret destroyed
  - Remove both the bullet and the turret from the game

### Balance Considerations
- Turrets are worth 50 points (more than mines but less than multiple asteroid destructions)
- Only player bullets can destroy turrets (turret bullets cannot destroy turrets)
- Turret explosions are purely visual and don't affect other game objects
- Turrets are relatively easy to spot and target due to their green square shape
