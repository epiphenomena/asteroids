# Turret Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

1. **Stationary Turret**: 
   - Added a turret that remains in a fixed position on the game field
   - Positioned at the top-right corner of the screen (relative to the ship's starting position)

2. **Turret Shooting**:
   - Turret shoots at the player's ship twice in quick succession
   - Has a 6-second cooldown period between shooting sequences
   - 0.5-second delay between the two shots in a sequence

3. **Visual Representation**:
   - Turret drawn as a green square with a directional indicator
   - Turret bullets are the same as player bullets but marked for collision detection

4. **Collision Detection**:
   - Turret bullets can destroy the player's ship
   - Turret bullets do not affect asteroids or mines (score is not increased)

## Technical Details

### New Variables
- `turrets`: Array to hold all turret objects
- `isTurretBullet`: Boolean flag on bullet objects to distinguish turret bullets

### New Functions
- `createTurret()`: Initializes a turret at a fixed position
- `updateTurrets()`: Updates turret positions and shooting logic
- `fireTurretBullet()`: Fires a bullet from a turret toward the ship
- `drawTurrets()`: Renders turrets on the screen

### Modified Functions
- `resetGame()`: Initializes turrets when game resets
- `update()`: Calls turret update function
- `updateShip()`: Handles turret movement with the world
- `checkCollisions()`: Added collision detection for turret bullets and ship
- `render()`: Calls turret drawing function

## Balance Considerations

- Turret bullets are slightly slower than player bullets (speed 7 vs 10)
- Turret bullets have a longer lifespan than player bullets (180 frames vs 120)
- Turrets have a significant cooldown (6 seconds) between shooting sequences
- Turrets don't affect the player's score when they destroy asteroids/mines
