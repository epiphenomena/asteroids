# Enemies Per Wave Fix

## Overview
Fixed the enemies per wave system to properly use the wave progression instead of hardcoded initial enemy creation. Previously, the game was creating a fixed set of enemies at startup instead of following the wave-based progression system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Enemy Initialization
- **Before**: Game created fixed enemies directly in resetGame()
- **After**: Game calls spawnWaveEnemies() to use wave progression
- **Impact**: First wave now follows proper enemy scaling

### 2. Hardcoded Enemy Creation
- **Before**: 3 asteroids, 12 turrets, 10 army men, powerups, and 1 rose created directly
- **After**: Wave 1 enemies created according to spawnWaveEnemies() formula
- **Impact**: Consistent wave progression from the start

### 3. Wave System Bypass
- **Before**: Initial enemies were not part of wave system
- **After**: All enemies now part of wave progression
- **Impact**: Proper wave advancement and win condition

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Functions
- `resetGame()`: Removed hardcoded enemy creation
- `resetGame()`: Added call to spawnWaveEnemies() for proper initialization
- `spawnWaveEnemies()`: Already correctly implemented

### New Behavior
- Game starts with Wave 1 enemies (1 asteroid, 0 mines, 0 army men)
- Wave progression works correctly from Wave 1
- All enemies created through wave system
- Win condition properly tracks waves (Wave 15 victory)

## Wave Progression Restored

### Wave 1 (Fixed)
- **Before**: 3 asteroids, 12 turrets, 10 army men, powerups, 1 rose
- **After**: 1 asteroid, 0 mines, 0 army men, 1 rose, powerups

### Wave 2
- 2 asteroids, 0 mines, 0 army men, 1 rose, powerups

### Wave 3
- 3 asteroids, 1 mine, 3 army men, 1 rose, powerups

### Wave 4
- 4 asteroids, 1 mine, 3 army men, 1 turret, 1 rose, powerups

### Wave 5
- 5 asteroids, 1 mine, 3 army men, 1 turret, 1 rose, powerups

And so on, following the proper wave progression.

## Game Balance Improvements

### Starting Difficulty
- **Before**: Overwhelming initial challenge with many enemies
- **After**: Manageable Wave 1 with minimal enemies
- **Impact**: Better onboarding for new players

### Progression Curve
- **Before**: Jump from Wave 1 (many enemies) to Wave 2 (normal scaling)
- **After**: Smooth progression from Wave 1 to Wave 15
- **Impact**: More consistent difficulty increase

### Learning Curve
- **Before**: Steep initial learning curve
- **After**: Gentle introduction with gradual challenge increase
- **Impact**: Better player retention and skill development

## Player Experience Enhancements

### Accessibility
- **New Players**: Less intimidating initial challenge
- **Casual Gamers**: More approachable starting experience
- **Skill Building**: Time to learn basics before facing harder challenges

### Satisfaction
- **Progression**: Clear sense of advancement with each wave
- **Achievement**: Meaningful progression from Wave 1 to Wave 15
- **Mastery**: Opportunity to develop skills gradually

### Challenge Maintenance
- **Early Game**: Manageable but engaging
- **Mid Game**: Progressive difficulty through wave scaling
- **Late Game**: Substantial challenge with accumulated enemies

## Technical Details

### Performance Considerations
- **Enemy Count**: Reduced initial enemy load
- **Memory Usage**: Lower initial memory footprint
- **Processing**: Less initial processing overhead

### Compatibility
- **Existing Code**: Fully compatible with wave system
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Save Files**: No impact on saved game data

### Verification
- **Wave Tracking**: Proper wave number display
- **Enemy Scaling**: Correct enemy counts per wave
- **Win Condition**: Wave 15 victory properly triggered
- **Progression**: Smooth advancement between waves

The fix restores the intended wave progression system, making the game more accessible while maintaining the challenge through consistent difficulty scaling. Players now experience the full wave progression from Wave 1 to Wave 15 as designed.
