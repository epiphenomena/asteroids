# Radar Indicators Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added radar indicators to show the direction of off-screen objects in the asteroids game. These are arrows that appear at the edges of the screen and point toward asteroids, mines, turrets, and army men that are currently off-screen.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Drawing System
- Added `drawRadarIndicators()` function that iterates through all game objects
- Added `drawRadarIndicator(worldX, worldY, color)` function to draw a single indicator

### 2. Object Coverage
- Radar indicators are shown for:
  - Asteroids (white arrows)
  - Mines (red arrows)
  - Turrets (green arrows)
  - Army Men (red arrows)

### 3. Positioning Logic
- Only shows indicators for objects that are significantly off-screen (beyond a 50-pixel margin)
- Positions indicators at the edge of the screen with a 30-pixel margin
- Keeps indicators within screen bounds
- Arrows rotate to point toward the actual position of the off-screen object

### 4. Visual Design
- Arrows use the same color coding as the objects they represent
- Simple arrow design with a shaft and arrowhead
- Clean, minimal appearance that doesn't clutter the screen

### 5. Integration
- Added radar indicators to the main rendering loop
- Works with existing world coordinate system
- Consistent with game's visual style

## Files Modified
- `script.js` - Main game implementation
- `test_radar.js` - Test script for radar indicators functionality
- `test_radar.html` - Test HTML file

## How to Test
1. Open `test_radar.html` in a browser
2. Click "START TEST"
3. Move away from objects or let them move off-screen
4. Observe the arrows at screen edges pointing toward off-screen objects
5. Move back toward objects to see arrows disappear when objects come on-screen
