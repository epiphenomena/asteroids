# Game Over Screen Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The game over screen was appearing after 5 seconds of starting the game due to automated testing scripts that were interfering with normal gameplay.

## Root Cause

The `test_crash.js` file contained automated tests that:
1. Automatically triggered a game over scenario after 5 seconds
2. Forced the game over by setting lives to 0 and calling endGame()

## Solution Implemented

1. **Modified test_crash.js**:
   - Commented out the automatic game over test that was triggering after 5 seconds
   - Commented out the testGameOverScenario function to prevent it from being called
   - Ensured that the test scripts no longer interfere with normal gameplay

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `test_crash.js`: Commented out automatic game over triggering code

### Changes Made
- Commented out the setTimeout that called testGameOverScenario after 5 seconds
- Commented out the testGameOverScenario function entirely
- Commented out another call to testGameOverScenario in testShipControls

## Impact

- The game over screen no longer appears automatically after 5 seconds
- Normal gameplay is no longer interrupted by automated tests
- Test scripts can still be used for development and debugging when needed
- Players can now enjoy the full game without artificial game over triggers
