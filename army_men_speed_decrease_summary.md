# Army Men Speed Decrease Implementation

## Overview
Decreased the speed of army men to make them easier to avoid and give players more time to react. This change improves game accessibility while maintaining the challenge through strategic positioning and timing.

## Speed Changes

### Movement Parameters
- **Base Speed**: Decreased from 1.95 to 1.2 (38% slower)
- **Maximum Speed**: Decreased from 3.25 to 2.0 (38% slower)
- **Acceleration**: Decreased from 0.065 to 0.04 (38% slower)

### Impact Analysis
- **Chase Behavior**: Army men still actively chase the player but at a reduced pace
- **Reaction Time**: Players have more time to react to approaching army men
- **Avoidance**: Easier to dodge and weave between army men
- **Strategic Depth**: More forgiving mistakes while maintaining challenge

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Functions
- `createArmyMan()`: Updated speed parameters and added acceleration property
- `updateArmyMen()`: Updated to use new acceleration value

### New Behavior
- Army men accelerate toward player at 0.04 units per frame
- Maximum velocity capped at 2.0 units per frame
- Initial speed randomized between 0.5-1.5 units per frame
- Same chasing algorithm but with reduced parameters

## Game Balance Improvements

### Accessibility
- **New Players**: Easier to learn basic avoidance techniques
- **Casual Gamers**: Less frustrating when starting out
- **Reaction Time**: More generous windows for player responses
- **Mistake Forgiveness**: Reduced penalty for momentary lapses

### Skill Expression
- **Precision**: Rewards accurate positioning and timing
- **Strategy**: Encourages thoughtful movement patterns
- **Spacing**: Better spacing between army men becomes more manageable
- **Combination**: Works well with roses' poison bullet patterns

### Challenge Maintenance
- **Numbers**: Wave progression still increases army men count
- **Coordination**: Multiple army men still require attention
- **Positioning**: Still dangerous when bunched together
- **Timing**: Require more precise timing for avoidance

## Player Experience Enhancements

### Reduced Frustration
- **Close Calls**: Less likely to die from unavoidable situations
- **Pattern Recognition**: More time to recognize movement patterns
- **Escape Routes**: Better opportunities to break free from clusters
- **Confidence**: Players feel more capable of handling threats

### Increased Engagement
- **Flow State**: Better balance between challenge and skill
- **Progression**: Smoother difficulty curve for skill development
- **Satisfaction**: More successful dodges lead to greater satisfaction
- **Retention**: More likely to continue playing after minor setbacks

## Wave Progression Impact

### Army Men Scaling
- **Wave 1-3**: 3 army men per wave (still manageable)
- **Wave 4-6**: 6 army men per wave (more presence but slower)
- **Wave 7-9**: 9 army men per wave (density over speed)
- **Wave 10-15**: 12-15 army men per wave (strategic challenge)

### Synergy with Other Systems
- **Roses**: Slower army men are easier targets for poison bullets
- **Turrets**: Complement reduced army men speed with area control
- **Powerups**: Force field and bullet size still valuable
- **Player Ship**: Maintains relative agility advantage

## Technical Details

### Performance Considerations
- **Physics Calculations**: Same computational complexity, just reduced values
- **Frame Rate**: No impact on performance
- **Memory Usage**: No change in memory footprint
- **Collision Detection**: Same efficient algorithms with updated speeds

### Compatibility
- **Existing Code**: Fully backward compatible
- **No Breaking Changes**: All other systems unaffected
- **Save Files**: No impact on saved game data
- **Network Code**: N/A (single-player game)

The speed decrease makes army men more approachable while preserving their role as a meaningful threat. Players can now develop their skills with less pressure while still facing genuine challenges from the increasing numbers and strategic positioning requirements.
