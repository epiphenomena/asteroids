# asteroids
Your basic asteroids clone


Asteroids is a game where the user is a small triangular ship that shoots asteroid destroying bullets out the front and flies around in space.
The space is sied based upon the viewport and just outside the viewport it wraps around to the opposing side. So asteroids that float off one side eventually appear coming back in the other side.
The bullets that the user's ship shoots do not wrap around in space.

This is an html/js/css game. It should all be vanilla js/css. It is a static html page. Optimized for and intended for use on mobile.
